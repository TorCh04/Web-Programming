This website is to help you learn the standard 5-1 volleyball rotations. There are six rotations in total, and each rotation has its own unique receive and blocking formations.

To use this website, simply click on the button for the rotation you want to learn about. A new section will open up with information about the rotation, as well as images of the receive and blocking formations.

Here is a brief overview of each rotation:

Rotation 1
Setter is in Position 1
Primary passers are 4B and Libero/M1
Secondary passers are Opp and 4A
This is often the first rotation, and it is one where you can side out quickly

Rotation 2
Setter is front court (FC) in Position 2
Primary passers are 4B and Libero/M1
Secondary passers are Opp and 4A
The server will likely target zone 5 in an attempt to reduce the FC attack from 4A

Rotation 3
Setter is front court (FC) in Position 3
Primary passers are 4B and Libero/M1
Secondary passers are Opp and 4A
The server will likely target zone 5 in an attempt to reduce the FC attack from 4A

Rotation 4
Setter is front court (FC) in Position 4
Primary passers are 4B and Libero/M1
Secondary passers are Opp and 4A
There are a number of variations here, but normally you will stack at 4 with the setter moving swiftly into setting zone at 2

Rotation 5
Setter is in Position 5
Primary passers are 4B and Libero/M1
Secondary passers are Opp and 4A
Be aware of your rotation, as the setter is back court in 5

Rotation 6
Setter is in Position 6
Primary passers are 4B, Libero/M1, and 4A
Secondary passers are Opp and 4A
The server will likely target 4B in an attempt to eliminate them from the attack
I hope this website helps you learn the standard 5-1 volleyball rotations. Good luck!
